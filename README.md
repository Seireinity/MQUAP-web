# MQUAP-web Version 1.0

[WIP] - My current prototype for my thesis with text matching to determine the percentage match and matched topics of course content to certification content. Text Matching uses algorithms: Brute Force String Pattern Matching and Cosine Similarity.

Database is LOCAL through MySQL PHPMyAdmin. 
08/08 - Will upload in 00webhost

Uploading files to the system uses PhpOffice/PhpSpreadsheet
