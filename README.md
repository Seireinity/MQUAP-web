# MQUAP-web Version 1.0

[WIP] - My current prototype for my thesis with text matching to determine the percentage match of course content to certification content. Text Matching uses algorithms: Brute Force String Pattern Matching and Cosine Similarity. This will present which certifications are a match to a course.

Database is LOCAL through MySQL PHPMyAdmin. 
August 8, 2022 : Will host online in 00webhost

Sample data has already been added. 
1. Select curriculum: Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
2. Select course (Certifications): BIT212K Object-Oriented Programming 1
3. Proceed to Matching!

Uploading files to the system uses PhpOffice/PhpSpreadsheet
Cosine Similarity from https://github.com/mlwmlw/php-cosine-similarity.git
