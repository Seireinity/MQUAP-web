# MQUAP-web Version 1.0

My prototype for my thesis with text matching to determine the percentage match of course content to certification content. Text Matching uses algorithms: Brute Force String Pattern Matching and Cosine Similarity. This will present which certifications are a match to a course.

Database is LOCAL through MySQL PHPMyAdmin. 

Uploading files to the system uses PhpOffice/PhpSpreadsheet

Cosine Similarity from https://github.com/mlwmlw/php-cosine-similarity.git

This project is for educational purposes only. An internet connection is required.
